# Binary-Search-Tree
The Binary Search Tree project is a comprehensive implementation of a binary search tree data structure coding. 
It offers a robust and efficient solution for storing and managing ordered data in a tree-like structure.

This project provides a wide range of functionality for working with binary search trees.
It includes operations such as inserting new nodes, searching for specific values, deleting nodes, 
and traversing the tree in different orders (pre-order, in-order, post-order). 
Additionally, it supports common tree-related operations like finding the minimum or maximum value.
